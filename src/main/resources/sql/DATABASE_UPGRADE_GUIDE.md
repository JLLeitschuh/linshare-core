## Migration with particularity

### 1.4.0 to 1.5.0

* postgresql :
This migration script must be run with user postgres because we used plpgpsql language.

For postgresql 8+, you may need to comment "DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS plpgsql;" command from the migration script
because this version do not support it.

* mysql :
Nothing particular.
